This plugin adds an "Email Test" option within your WooCommerce menu. From there, you can specify a test order, and view test emails for the following email types:

* Cancelled Order
* Failed Order

If you have the WooCommerce subscription plugin, you can test the emails associated with this plugin. These are:

* Completed Renewal Order
* Completed Switch Order
* Customer Renewal Invoice

Any updates to the premium plugin will be available to you at no extra cost.
